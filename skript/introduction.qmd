# Introduction ASET

ASET (Available Safe Egress Time) is a critical concept in fire safety 
engineering that represents the time available for occupants to safely evacuate 
a building before conditions become untenable due to fire, smoke, or heat. It 
is calculated based on factors such as fire growth rate, detection time, and 
the building's design features, including exits and fire suppression systems. 
Ensuring that the ASET exceeds the Required Safe Egress Time (RSET) is 
essential for developing effective evacuation plans and enhancing the safety of 
building occupants during an emergency.

## Data acquisation

The data we will look at were generated using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). 
FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator) is a computational fluid dynamics model used to 
simulate fire-driven fluid flow, allowing for the analysis and prediction of 
fire behavior and its impact on buildings and environments.
